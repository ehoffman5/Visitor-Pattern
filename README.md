# Visitor Pattern

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of a visitor pattern.

It consists of a collection of visitors and visitables who attend a school.  Currently, the visitor is the school nurse, and the visitables are the students and teachers.

### The Problem:
Before applying the visitor pattern, the operational logic for this program would have had to be updated for each new class.

### The Solution:
Implementing the visitor pattern allows us to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which
it operates.

### To Run:
1) Clone this repository to your local device.
2) Open the project in your IDE of choice.
3) Build the project and run it using the RunClient.java file.
